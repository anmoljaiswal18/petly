# Petly 🐾  
Petly is a mobile app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native that helps pet lovers connect, discover, and build a community — inspired by swipe-based interactions.  

## 🚀 Get Started  

1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
````

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You can then open the app in:

   * [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   * [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   * [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   * [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (limited sandbox environment)

## 📂 Project Structure

This project uses **file-based routing**. All screens and components live inside the **app** directory.

```
app/
 ├── index.js         # Home screen  
 ├── pets/            # Pet profiles & details  
 ├── matches/         # Matches and chats  
 ├── components/      # Reusable UI components  
 └── assets/          # Images, icons, fonts
```

## 🧩 Features

* Swipe left ❌ to reject
* Swipe right ✅ to connect with pet/owner
* Mutual right swipes → **It's a match!** 💌
* User profiles with pet details (name, breed, age, distance, owner info)
* Simple & clean UI with Expo Router

## 🛠️ Scripts

* Reset the project:

  ```bash
  npm run reset-project
  ```

  This will move the starter code to `app-example` and give you a blank `app` folder.

## 🌱 Future Scope

Petly is starting simple, but has a lot of growth potential:

   * Owner & pet profile customization

2. **Location & Discovery**

   * GPS-based pet matching within custom radius
   * Advanced filters (breed, age, size, availability for adoption/playdate)

3. **Social Features**

   * Direct messaging & photo sharing
   * Pet stories & timeline posts (like Instagram)
   * Following pets & building a community

4. **Adoption & Services**

   * Connect with NGOs, shelters, and breeders
   * Integration with veterinary services, groomers, trainers

5. **Gamification**

   * Reward system for active users
   * Badges for pet achievements (e.g., "Most Loved Pup 🐶")

6. **AI & Smart Features**

   * AI-generated pet recommendations based on preferences
   * Health tracking & reminders for vaccinations

💡 Petly is more than an app — it’s about building a **community for pet lovers**.

Do you want me to also add **GitHub badges (Expo, React Native, License, etc.)** at the top so it looks more professional for open-source?
